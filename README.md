# Immersify

There are total 5 projects of Data Science domain and from that 5 projects i have to select any 2 projects and make the model and train and test it with good accuracy. the 5 projects are :

1. Iris Flower Classification
2. Movie Rating Prediction
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
4. Titanic Survival Prediction
5. Sales Prediction

From above 5 projects i have chosen 2 projects named -  Iris Flower Classification and Credit Card Fraud Detection. The Broad idea about this 2 projects are as follows:

1. Iris Flower Classification
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Using the well-known Iris dataset, which contains sepal and petal measurement data for these species, the goal is to develop a robust classification model. The project provides an opportunity to explore foundational machine learning concepts, including:
Data preprocessing and visualization
Feature selection
Model training and testing
Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
This serves as an ideal starting point for understanding the basics of supervised learning.


2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
The focus of this project is to design a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Key tasks include:
Preprocessing transaction data and normalizing features.
Addressing the challenge of imbalanced datasets (e.g., through oversampling or undersampling techniques).
Splitting data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Employing classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions.
Evaluating model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
This project not only emphasizes the application of machine learning to a real-world problem but also highlights the importance of data preprocessing and proper evaluation to ensure the reliability of results.
