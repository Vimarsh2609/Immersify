# Immersify

There are total 5 projects of Data Science domain and from that 5 projects i have to select any 2 projects and make the model and train and test it with good accuracy. the 5 projects are :

1. Iris Flower Classification
2. Movie Rating Prediction
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
4. Titanic Survival Prediction
5. Sales Prediction

From above 5 projects i have chosen 2 projects named -  Iris Flower Classification and Credit Card Fraud Detection. The idea, Workflow, Models and other details regarding this 2 projects are as follows:

1. Iris Flower Classification
   
Objective:
Build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, using the Iris dataset.

Dataset:
The Iris dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains sepal and petal measurements along with the species label (class).

Project Workflow:
     Data Preprocessing:
          Load and inspect the dataset.
          Perform exploratory data analysis, including statistical summaries (describe).
     Data Visualization:
          Use seaborn's pair plots to visualize relationships between features and identify patterns across species.
     Feature Engineering:
          Separate the features (sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width) from the target label (class).
     Model Training:
          Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier on the dataset.
     Model Evaluation:
          Assess the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy and classification reports.
          
Key Insights:
This project demonstrates how to preprocess, visualize, and model data using Python.
It provides hands-on experience with supervised learning techniques and evaluation metrics.

Learning Outcomes:
Understand foundational concepts in supervised machine learning.
Learn to build and evaluate a classification model.
Gain experience with Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn.




2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
   
Objective:
Design a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions accurately using transaction data.

Dataset:
The dataset contains transaction details such as amount, time, and anonymized features, along with a binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or genuine (0).
Imbalanced class distribution: Fraudulent transactions make up a small percentage of the dataset.

Project Workflow:

  Data Preprocessing:
      Load and inspect the dataset.
      Handle missing or anomalous values, if any.
      Normalize or scale features to ensure consistent input to machine learning algorithms.
   Addressing Class Imbalance:
      Apply techniques such as oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling to balance the dataset and improve model performance on 
      minority classes.
   Data Splitting:
      Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
   Model Training:
      Train classification models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, to distinguish between fraudulent and 
      genuine transactions.
   Model Evaluation:
      Evaluate the model using metrics such as:
          Precision: How many predicted fraudulent transactions are truly fraudulent.
          Recall: How many actual fraudulent transactions are correctly identified.
          F1-Score: Balance between precision and recall.
          AUC-ROC: The area under the ROC curve to measure the model's discriminatory power.
          
Key Insights:
The project highlights the importance of handling imbalanced datasets in fraud detection tasks.
It emphasizes the role of proper preprocessing and feature scaling to enhance model performance.
A thorough evaluation ensures the reliability of the results, especially in high-risk applications like fraud detection.

Learning Outcomes:
Gain a deeper understanding of machine learning techniques for imbalanced datasets.
Learn how to preprocess and normalize transaction data effectively.
Build and evaluate classification models using Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and visualization tools like seaborn and matplotlib.
Develop skills to use performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for model evaluation.
